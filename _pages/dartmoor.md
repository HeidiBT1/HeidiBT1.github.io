I need something to in 2024 so I've decided to trek to as many tors as possible on Dartmoor. Depending on who you ask and what you include as a tor, there's anywhere from about 100 to 900 tors on Dartmoor. I'm aiming to get to 50 this year, with a stretch goal of 100. 

Here's where I'll document each tor.
