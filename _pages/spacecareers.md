I get a lot of emails asking "how do I get a career in space?", "where can I do space work experience?", "what do I need to study to work in the space sector?"

Unfortunately, I don't have time to answer everyone individually.

Luckily, my friends and I built a website that will answer (nearl) all your questions... _[SpaceCareers.uk](www.SpaceCareers.uk)_ 

If you've read everything on SpaceCareers.uk and still can't find the answer, feel free to drop me an email.
