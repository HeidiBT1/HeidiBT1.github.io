That's fantastic! Working in the space sector is one of the best things I've done so far.

I get a lot of emails asking "how do I get a career in space?", "where can I do space work experience?", "what do I need to study to work in the space sector?"

Unfortunately, I don't have time to answer everyone individually.

Luckily, my friends and I built a website that will answer (nearly) all your questions... _[SpaceCareers.uk](www.SpaceCareers.uk)_ It's currently maintained by the lovely people at _[UKSEDS](https://ukseds.org/)_ 

_[SpaceCareers.uk](https://spacecareers.uk/)_ has everything you need to know on it. It's got a whole load of current jobs, events, and competitions, and a huge bank of 30 job profiles, 40 advice articles, and 75 interviews.

Do you have any Cornwall-specific advice?
==

This is a bit more niche so I'm collating my own set of Cornwall-specific space careers advice here. Be warned: it's a work in progress. I'll add more when I find the time.

**What space companies are even in Cornwall?**

Aerospace Cornwall has made a lovely [map](https://aerospacecornwall.co.uk/cornwall-space/space-cluster-map) to provide just the answer.

**Can I study on a space course?**

Yes! My team's developed the Level 4 Space Engineering Technician Apprenticeship, Space Technology HNC, and Space Technology HND. You can find more details [here](https://ols.mis.truro-penwith.ac.uk/WCFWebSite/Admissions/courseDetails.aspx?from=tpc&id=201000688286115). We expect that companies will start recruiting for the apprenticeship in March/April 2022. To apply, you'll need A-Levels or Level 3 equivalent in a STEM subject. More details about the HNC/HND to come.

**Where can I do space work experience or an internship in Cornwall?**

* [Goonhilly Earth Station](https://www.goonhilly.org/careers) sometimes offers work experience and internships
* [Spaceport Cornwall](https://www.careershubcios.co.uk/events/spaceport-cornwall-young-space-entrepreneurs-vwex/) offered virtual work experience during the lockdowns. Keep an eye out for future opportunities
* [SPIN](https://sa.catapult.org.uk/work-with-us/space-placements-industry-spin/) or Space Placements in INdustry (for university students) sometimes has opportunities in Cornwall
* [Virtual work experience at Airbus](https://www.springpod.com/virtual-work-experience/aerospace-work-experience) is a great option if you can't find an in-person opportunity
