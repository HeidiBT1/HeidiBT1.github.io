I get a lot of emails asking "how do I get a career in space?", "where can I do space work experience?", "what do I need to study to work in the space sector?"

Unfortunately, I don't have time to answer everyone individually.

Luckily, my friends and I built a website that will answer (nearly) all your questions... _[SpaceCareers.uk](www.SpaceCareers.uk)_ It's currently maintained by the lovely people at _[UKSEDS](https://ukseds.org/)_ 

_[SpaceCareers.uk](www.SpaceCareers.uk)_ has everything you need to know on it. It's got a whole load of current jobs, events, and competitions, and a huge bank of 30 job profiles, 40 advice articles, and 75 interviews.

I'll add some Cornwall-specific advice when I have time.
