That's fantastic! Working in the space sector is one of the best things I've done so far.

I get a lot of emails asking "how do I get a career in space?", "where can I do space work experience?", "what do I need to study to work in the space sector?"

Unfortunately, I don't have time to answer everyone individually.

Luckily, my friends and I built and ran a website that will answer (nearly) all your questions... _[SpaceCareers.uk](www.SpaceCareers.uk)_ It's currently maintained by the lovely people at _[UKSEDS](https://ukseds.org/)_ 

_[SpaceCareers.uk](https://spacecareers.uk/)_ has everything you need to know on it. It's got a whole load of current jobs, events, and competitions, and a huge bank of 30 job profiles, 40 advice articles, and 75 interviews. There's probably more since I last checked.

Do you have any Cornwall-specific advice?
==

This is a bit more niche so I'm collating my own set of Cornwall-specific space careers advice here. Be warned: it's a work in progress. I'll add more when I find the time.

**What space companies are even in Cornwall?**

The Cornwall Space Cluster has made a lovely [map](https://www.cornwallspacecluster.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CSC-map-0322.pdf) to provide just the answer.

**Where can I find out find myself a space job in Cornwall?**

I'd recommend checking out the Cornwall Space Cluster's [careers website](https://www.cornwallspacecluster.co.uk/careers/). If you're looking at software-related space jobs, there's often some on the Software Cornwall [jobs board](https://softwarecornwall.org/jobs-board/).

**Where can I do space work experience or an internship in Cornwall?**

* [Goonhilly Earth Station](https://www.goonhilly.org/careers) sometimes offers work experience and internships.
* [SPIN](https://sa.catapult.org.uk/work-with-us/space-placements-industry-spin/) or Space Placements in INdustry (for university and college students) sometimes has opportunities in Cornwall.
* [Virtual work experience](https://www.springpod.com/virtual-work-experience/aerospace-work-experience) is a great option if you can't find an in-person opportunity. It's often offered by Spaceport Cornwall and other great space and aerospace companies too.
* [Mission to Mars at Software Cornwall](https://softwarecornwall.org/mission-to-mars/) for those interested in software and robotics.

**Can I study on a space course in Cornwall?**

Yes! You can complete a Level 4 Space Engineering Technician Apprenticeship and the Space Technology HNC and HND at Truro and Penwith College. You can find more details [here](https://www.truro-penwith.ac.uk/courses/apprenticeship-standard-space-engineering-technician-l4/).

Next Steps South West have also produced a map of space-related courses that you can study at college and university level right across the South West. Find it [here](https://nextstepssw.ac.uk/content/uploads/2022/10/NSSW-Space-Ed-Courses-Map.pdf).

**What other things can I do?**
