Hello! I'm Heidi, a third year PhD student in the School of Physical Sciences at The Open University, UK.


Research
======

My research focuses on different aspects of stellar variability in the SuperWASP all-sky survey. I'm currently working on binary stars and citizen science, and previously I worked on the rotation-activity relation. You can find out more about my research by click on "Research". 


Space Skills
======

Alongside my research, I co-direct the Space Skills Alliance. We are the think-tank and backbone organisation addressing the UK's space skills shortage. You can check out our latest research [here](https://spaceskills.org/).

Previously, I've lead [SpaceCareers.uk](https://spacecareers.uk/), the go-to careers resource for the space sector. Our work has been recognised by awards from the Prime Minister and BEIS.

I'm also a Senior Mentor at [Space School UK](http://spaceschool.co.uk/), and involved in many other space career schemes.
