Hello! I'm Heidi Thiemann (pronounced Tee-man) and I'm just finishing up my PhD in astronomy in the School of Physical Sciences at The Open University, UK.


Astronomy
======

My research focuses on a range of aspects of stellar variability in the SuperWASP all-sky survey with [Prof. Andrew Norton](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/ajn3) and [Dr Ulrich Kolb](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/uck2). Over the past 4 years I've worked on observing and modelling near-contact red giant binary stars, the _SuperWASP Variable Stars_ citizen science project, the rotation-activity relation, and the threat megaconstellations pose to ground-based astronomy. You can find out more by clicking on [Research](https://heidithiemann.github.io/research/). 


Space Skills
======

Alongside my research, I co-direct the [Space Skills Alliance](https://spaceskills.org/). We're the think-tank and backbone organisation addressing the UK's space skills shortage, by analysing skills demands and the quality of space job adverts, creating skills taxonomies, and running the first national census of the UK space sector

Previously, I led [SpaceCareers.uk](https://spacecareers.uk/), the go-to careers resource for the space sector. Our work has been recognised by awards from the Prime Minister and BEIS. I'm also a Senior Mentor at [Space School UK](http://spaceschool.co.uk/), and involved in many other STEM outreach, engagement, and careers programmes.
