Hello! I'm Heidi, a third year PhD student in the School of Physical Sciences at The Open University in the UK. 


Astronomy
======

My research focuses on different aspects of stellar variability in the SuperWASP all-sky survey. I'm currently working on near-contact binary stars and previously I've worked on the rotation-activity relation. 

I also dabble in citizen science and the threat megaconstellations pose to ground-based astronomy. You can find out more by clicking on [Research](https://heidibt1.github.io/research/). 


Space Skills
======

Alongside my research, I co-direct the [Space Skills Alliance](https://spaceskills.org/). We are the think-tank and backbone organisation addressing the UK's space skills shortage. Check out our latest research.

Previously, I've led [SpaceCareers.uk](https://spacecareers.uk/), the go-to careers resource for the space sector. Our work has been recognised by awards from the Prime Minister and BEIS.

I'm also a Senior Mentor at [Space School UK](http://spaceschool.co.uk/), and involved in many other STEM careers schemes.
