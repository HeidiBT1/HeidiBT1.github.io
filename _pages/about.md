Hello! I'm Dr. Heidi Thiemann (pronounced Tee-man), Project Manager at Truro & Penwith College and Director of the Space Skills Alliance. I was recently awarded a PhD in astrophysics from the School of Physical Sciences at The Open University, UK.

Space Technology Training
======
I'm currently a project manager at Truro & Penwith College, developing a suite of courses that will provide graduates and non-graduate staff within the Cornish space sector with the education and training needed to support new and existing businesses linked to the space industry. You can find out more [here](https://www.truro-penwith.ac.uk/csatt).

We're developing the first Space HNC and HND programme in the world, and delivering the first space apprenticeship programme in Cornwall. You can find out more about our vocational qualifications [here](https://ols.mis.truro-penwith.ac.uk/WCFWebSite/Admissions/courseDetails.aspx?from=tpc&id=201000688286115).

Space Skills
======

I co-direct the [Space Skills Alliance](https://spaceskills.org/). We're the think-tank and backbone organisation addressing the UK's space skills shortage. As a think-tank, we help the policy-making process by publishing reports that are as rigorous as academic research and as accessible as journalism. As a consultancy, we provide expert advice to organisations looking to improve their skills pipelines, not only recommending solutions, but also helping to institutionalise more effective processes. As a backbone organisation, we enable collaboration and improve the way organisations in the space sector work together to address common skills challenges.

Astronomy Research
======

My research focused on a range of aspects of stellar variability in the SuperWASP all-sky survey with [Prof. Andrew Norton](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/ajn3) and [Dr Ulrich Kolb](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/uck2). From 2017-2021 I worked on observing and modelling near-contact red giant binary stars, the _SuperWASP Variable Stars_ citizen science project, the rotation-activity relation, and the threat megaconstellations pose to ground-based astronomy. You can find out more by clicking on [Research](https://heidithiemann.github.io/research/).

Space Outreach
======

Previously, I led [SpaceCareers.uk](https://spacecareers.uk/), the go-to careers resource for the space sector. Our work has been recognised by awards from the Prime Minister and BEIS. In 2022 I founded Space Camp Cornwall, I'm a Senior Mentor at [Space School UK](http://spaceschool.co.uk/), and I'm involved in many other STEM outreach, engagement, and careers programmes.

I've only come to your website to find out about a career in space
