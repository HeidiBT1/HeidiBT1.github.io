Hello! I'm Heidi Thiemann (pronounced Tee-man), a fourth year PhD student in the School of Physical Sciences at The Open University in the UK. I expect to finish my PhD in June 2021, and I'm currently looking for a postdoctoral position.


Astronomy
======

My research focuses on different aspects of stellar variability in the SuperWASP all-sky survey with [Prof. Andrew Norton](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/ajn3) and [Dr Ulrich Kolb](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/uck2). I'm currently working on near-contact binary stars which may one day merge and form red novae. Previously I've worked on the rotation-activity relation. 

I'm also active in citizen science and the threat megaconstellations pose to ground-based astronomy. You can find out more by clicking on [Research](https://heidithiemann.github.io/research/). 


Space Skills
======

Alongside my research, I co-direct the [Space Skills Alliance](https://spaceskills.org/). We are the think-tank and backbone organisation addressing the UK's space skills shortage, currently carrying out the 2020 Space Census, the first demographic survey of the UK's space sector.

Previously, I've led [SpaceCareers.uk](https://spacecareers.uk/), the go-to careers resource for the space sector. Our work has been recognised by awards from the Prime Minister and BEIS. I'm also a Senior Mentor at [Space School UK](http://spaceschool.co.uk/), and involved in many other STEM outreach, engagement, and careers programmes.
