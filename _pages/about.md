Hello! I'm Dr. Heidi Thiemann (pronounced Tee-man), Space Technology Training Project Manager at Truro & Penwith College and Director of the Space Skills Alliance. Last year I finished a PhD in astrophysics in the School of Physical Sciences at The Open University, UK.

Space Technology Training
======
I'm currently a project manager at Truro & Penwith College, developing a suite of courses that will provide graduates and non-graduate staff within the Cornish space sector with the education and training needed to support new and existing businesses linked to the space industry. You can find out more [here](https://www.truro-penwith.ac.uk/csatt).

We're developing the first Space HNC and HND programme, and delivering the first space apprenticeship programme in Cornwall. You can find out more about the vocational qualifications [here](https://ols.mis.truro-penwith.ac.uk/WCFWebSite/Admissions/courseDetails.aspx?from=tpc&id=201000688286115).

Space Skills
======

I co-direct the [Space Skills Alliance](https://spaceskills.org/). We're the think-tank and backbone organisation addressing the UK's space skills shortage, by analysing skills demands and the quality of space job adverts, creating skills taxonomies, and running the first national census of the UK space sector

Previously, I led [SpaceCareers.uk](https://spacecareers.uk/), the go-to careers resource for the space sector. Our work has been recognised by awards from the Prime Minister and BEIS. This year I've founded Space Camp Cornwall, I'm a Senior Mentor at [Space School UK](http://spaceschool.co.uk/), and I'm involved in many other STEM outreach, engagement, and careers programmes.

Astronomy
======

I handed in my PhD in May 2021. My research focused on a range of aspects of stellar variability in the SuperWASP all-sky survey with [Prof. Andrew Norton](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/ajn3) and [Dr Ulrich Kolb](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/uck2). From 2017-2021 I worked on observing and modelling near-contact red giant binary stars, the _SuperWASP Variable Stars_ citizen science project, the rotation-activity relation, and the threat megaconstellations pose to ground-based astronomy. You can find out more by clicking on [Research](https://heidithiemann.github.io/research/). 

I've only come to your website to find out about a career in space
