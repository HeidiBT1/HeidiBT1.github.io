I'm Heidi, I work in the space industry and live in Devon. I enjoy the mix of cutting edge science and wassailing the apple trees. This website is an excuse to note things down so I don't forget what I've done with my career.

P.S. Thiemann is pronounced 'tee-man'.

Space skills
======

I co-direct the [Space Skills Alliance](https://spaceskills.org/), a think-tank and consultancy addressing the UK's space skills shortage. We publish research, data, and expert analysis for the UK and Europe and generally try to make graphs that looks better than your average pie chart. I also support [Goonhilly Earth Station](https://www.goonhilly.org/) with bid writing, training, and getting excited about communicating with spacecraft. Previously, I was a project manager at Truro & Penwith College. From 2021-2022 I lead the development of the first Space Technologies HNC/HND and delivered the first space apprenticeship programme in Cornwall.

Astronomy research
======

My [PhD research](https://heidithiemann.github.io/research/) focused on a range of aspects of stellar variability (how stars change in brightness) in the SuperWASP all-sky survey. From 2017-2021 I worked on observing and modelling near-contact red giant binary stars, the _SuperWASP Variable Stars_ citizen science project, the rotation-activity relation, and the threat megaconstellations pose to ground-based astronomy.

Trekking the tors of Dartmoor
======

In 2024 I plan on trekking across Dartmoor as often as physically possible. There should be some nice photos and grid references of tors on this website [here](https://heidithiemann.github.io/dartmoor/) soon.

I've only come to your website to find out about a career in space

[You're in luck...](https://heidithiemann.github.io/spacecareers/)
