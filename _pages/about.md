Hi, I'm Dr. Heidi Thiemann, Director of the Space Skills Alliance. 

Space Skills
======

I co-direct the [Space Skills Alliance](https://spaceskills.org/). We're the think-tank, consultancy, and backbone organisation addressing the UK's space skills shortage. We publish research, data, and expert analysis for the UK and Europe.

Consultancy
======
I support [Goonhilly Earth Station](https://www.goonhilly.org/) with bid writing, training, and other exciting projects.

Space Technology Training
======

Previously, I was a project manager at [Truro & Penwith College](https://www.truro-penwith.ac.uk/csatt). From 2021-2022 I lead the development of the first Space Technologies HNC/HND and delivered the first space apprenticeship programme in Cornwall.

Astronomy Research
======

My [PhD research](https://heidithiemann.github.io/research/) focused on a range of aspects of stellar variability in the SuperWASP all-sky survey. From 2017-2021 I worked on observing and modelling near-contact red giant binary stars, the _SuperWASP Variable Stars_ citizen science project, the rotation-activity relation, and the threat megaconstellations pose to ground-based astronomy.

I've only come to your website to find out about a career in space
======

[You're in luck...](https://heidithiemann.github.io/spacecareers/)
