Here's a short summary of what I've been working on during my PhD. Please get in touch if you'd like to know more.

Space School UK
======
Since 2014, I've been working as a mentor at Space School UK, a summer school for young people who are interested in space. As a Senior Mentor, I deliver lectures and workshops on a variety of space topics, mentor students and provide pastoral care, and train the new Junior Mentors each year.

We published a [paper on the impact of Space School UK](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2006/2006.06680.pdf) in 2019.

Public engagement
======
Over the years, I've been involved in many space and STEM public engagement and outreach activities. These include:
* Space Speaker in your Classroom
* I'm a Scientist
* PubhD
* Space Camp UK
* Soapbox Science
* VWEX

During my time as a volunteer then member of the Executive Committee for UKSEDS, I also led the development and organisation of national competitions, events, and conferences for thousands of young people interested in the space industry and space careers.
