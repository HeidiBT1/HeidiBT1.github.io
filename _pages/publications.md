======

I love baking, and at The Open University I've taken part in every "Bake Your Research" competition. Check out my [eclipsing contact binary star cakes](https://twitter.com/heidi_teaman/status/1050045772371283979/photo/3), and my attempt at baking the [PIRATE telescope](https://twitter.com/heidi_teaman/status/1194254321266896896).
