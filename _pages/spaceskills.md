I'm passionate about improving opportunities for people who want to join the space sector. I started as an undergraduate, putting thousands of hours into leading UKSEDS, the national student space society, and as the head of the SpaceCareers.uk team. 

A few years down the line, and I'm still actively in the space skills domain. Here's a few examples of the activities I've been involved in recently.

Space Skills Alliance
======
I co-founded the Space Skills Alliance with my good friend Joseph Dudley, which exists to tackle the space skills shortage, by collecting and publishing data and analysis, promoting and advising on best practice, and bringing key stakeholders together to collaborate and learn from each other.

We've been active since September 2019, and since then we've published analysis on skills demands for early career space jobs, the quality of space jobs, a space competencies taxonomy, and more.

In 2020, we launched the 2020 Space Census, which will, for the first time, establish the demographic make-up of UK space sector employees across industry, universities and government organisations. You see the first results of the [2020 Space Census here](https://spaceskills.org/census). 

You can check out our other work [here](https://spaceskills.org/).

SpaceCareers.uk
======
In 2017, I took over as the head of SpaceCareers.uk after over a year of volunteering for the site. Myself and my team made SpaceCareers.uk the go-to resource for the space sector, and we now have over 10,000 monthly users. We've received multiple awards for our work, from the Prime Minister, BEIS, and others. I've organised national careers events for young people, and spent countless hours improving opportunities for others who want to join the space sector.

Panels and collaborations
======
I'm currently involved in a number of space sector panels and organisations:
* Member of Space Skills Advisory Panel (SSAP), advising the UK Space Agency and BEIS on skills provision
* Member of the Cornwall Space Cluster Steering Group
* Member of the Space Universities Network (SUN)
* Social Media Manager for Women In Aerospace-Europe (WIA-E)
* Advisor to SpaceCareers.uk
* Represented both the Royal Astronomical Society and The Open University in the Voice of the Future events in the House of Commons

Space School UK
======
Since 2014, I've been working as a mentor at Space School UK, a summer school for young people who are interested in space. As a Senior Mentor, I deliver lectures and workshops on a variety of space topics, mentor students and provide pastoral care, and train the new Junior Mentors each year.

We published a [paper on the impact of Space School UK](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2006/2006.06680.pdf) in 2019.

Public engagement
======
Over the years, I've been involved in many space and STEM public engagement and outreach activities. These include:
* Space Speaker in your Classroom
* I'm a Scientist
* PubhD
* Space Camp UK
* Soapbox Science
* VWEX

During my time as a volunteer then member of the Executive Committee for UKSEDS, I also led the development and organisation of national competitions, events, and conferences for thousands of young people interested in the space industry and space careers.
